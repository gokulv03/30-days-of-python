# 🐍 Python Basics: Learning Progress

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey through core Python concepts. My current focus has been on understanding the building blocks of the language, especially around data structures, control flow, and functions.

---

## ✅ Topics Covered

### 🔹 Collection Data Types
- **List**
  - Creation, indexing, slicing
  - Common operations: `append()`, `extend()`, `pop()`, `sort()`, etc.
  - Looping through lists
- **Tuple**
  - Immutable sequences
  - Tuple packing/unpacking
  - Used when data should not be changed
- **defaultdict** (`collections.defaultdict`)
  - Dictionary subclass that provides default values
  - Helpful for counting and grouping

---

### 🔹 Control Structures
- Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Nested conditions
- `match` / `case` (Python 3.10+) for cleaner branching
- Loop control: `continue`, `break`

---

### 🔹 Loops and Iteration
- `for` loops over:
  - Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
  - Strings (character by character)
- `enumerate()` for indexed iteration
- `zip()` for looping over multiple collections
- `range()` for numeric sequences
- List comprehensions for clean and compact loops

---

### 🔹 Functions
- Defining and calling functions
- Parameters and return values
- Default arguments (`def func(arg=value)`)
- Variable arguments: `*args`, `**kwargs`
- Lambda functions (anonymous one-liners)
- Nested functions
- Reusable logic (e.g., prime filters, sum of even numbers)

---

## 🧠 Practice Exercises and Mini Projects
- Character frequency counter using `defaultdict`
- Grouping names by first letter
- Prime number filter using functions
- Math utility functions (factorial, average)
- Conditional logic: positive/negative/zero checker
- Custom loop filters using `continue` and `break`

---

## 📌 Purpose

This phase is focused on building a **solid foundation in Python** before transitioning to more advanced topics such as:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File I/O and exception handling
- Modules and packages
- Real-world automation and scripting

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Learn classes and objects in Python
- Understand file reading/writing
- Begin small CLI tools and scripts
- Dive into data analysis or web automation

> 🛠️ This journey is part of my master's studies in Electrical and Information Technology, where I focus on Medical Applications of Electromagnetic Waves. Python is a key tool for data processing and automation in this domain.
